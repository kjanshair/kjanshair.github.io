I am an experienced DevOps Engineer with a high level of proficiency in cloud computing, distributed systems, containers and security. I have built upon my conceptual knowledge in different facets of DevOps such as managing both on-premises and public cloud (Azure and AWS) infrastructure, CI/CD, containerization, networking, configuration management, agile, system programming and architecting robust solutions.
