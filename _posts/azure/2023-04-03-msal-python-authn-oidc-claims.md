This post is about how to use Flask to get authenticated with the Microsoft Identity Platform. This post is about AuthN (Authentication) only which will display claims contained in the ID Token which we will get from the Microsoft Identity Platform using [MSAL](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python) (Microsoft Authentication Library) for Python.
